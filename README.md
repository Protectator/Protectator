Hi ! My name is Kewin Dousse. You might also know me as Protectator. I work as a full stack developer at Apptitude in Switzerland.
My main interests are high-level programming languages, web design and game design.

I sometimes post my thoughts about subjects related mostly to programming and gaming on my blog.
